## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

[Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error:
   * Syntax Errors are spelling errors that either prevent the program from running, or stop working part-way through.
   * Logic Errors are where the syntax is correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past assignments and explain how you were able to correct them:
   * I'm pretty good about avoiding syntax errors, but I get logic errors all the time. I used console.log() to identify where the error occurred, then just work through the logic to fix it.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
   * Debugging is a very important tool to software development. It's easy to make a mistake, but if you are strong at debugging you can identify the problem and come up with a solution.

## The JavaScript Debugger

[JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
   * It's just a tool that lives inside the browser that allows us to look at the code and identify errors.

2. Define what a breakpoint is:
   * places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problem preventing the code from executing properly.

3. What is the call stack?
   * this section shows you what code was executed to get the current line.
