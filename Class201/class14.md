## CSS Transforms

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
   * Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth.

2. Provide an example of a CSS transform and how you could see that being used on a website:

2D transform with the rotate value provides the ability to rotate the element from 0 to 360 degrees. If a positive element is used, it rotates clockwise. If a negative element is used, it rotates counter-clockwise.

## CSS Transitions and Animations

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
