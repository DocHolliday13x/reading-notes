# Class 04 Reading Assignment

## Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or  other content inside what element? <a href= "URL"></a>

2. The href attribute contains what information?
the hypertext reference, or target, contains the web address

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accesible to all readers?
Use clear link wording. Include keywords in your link text to describe what's being linked to.


## CSS Layout

1. What is meant by "normal flow"?
the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout by applying any CSS to change the way they behave.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
block level elements content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it, and the element grows along the block dimension to accomodate content. 
in line elements is just the size of their content, you can't set height or width on inline elements, they just sit inside the content of block level elements.

3. _________ positioning is the default for every HTML element.
static

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
We can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. This means that you can create UI items that are fixed in place.


## Learn JavaScript

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation:
delcaring a function is just a way of saying you defined a function so that you can call on it to run (invoke).

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
parameters are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses. These are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.


## Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
   1. Learning from fellow students:
   Working with a teammate can help you identify techniques you otherwise may not have thought of, which provides a learning opportunity you may not have gotten. Plus, if you have a particular set of skills that make up for an area where your partner isn't as well versed, they can in turn lean on you for guidance, providing them with a learning opportunity as well.

   2. Job Interview Readiness: 
   It's fairly common for an applicant to have to execute some paired programming with a current employee during an interview, whether that is in person or through a shared screen. They will judge your ability to work with and learn from others, and they will observe how well you communicate with your team.
