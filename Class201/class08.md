1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items. Instead of setting rigid dimensions for the browser to follow, with flexbox, you can instead provide flexible boundaries to hint how the content could display.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
if the flex-direction is along the row, the main axis is the row. If it's the column, the main axis is the column. The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as a row across the page, or a column down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the main start and main end.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessbility?
Flexbox support is available in most new browsers, but there are stil older browsers that don't support flexbox.
