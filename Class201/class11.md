[Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000's.
The first influx of online video and audio were made possible by plugin-based tecnologies like Flash and Silverlight, both os which had security and accessibility issues and are also now obsolete. We now use HTML elements <video> and <audio> along with JavaScript APIs.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element:
the src attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. the controls attribute allows people to have control, so you either need this or to build your interface using JavaScript APIs.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
It can be displayed if the browser does not support the video element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers.

4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters:
<audio> and <video> are just two totally human characters. <audio> is very loud, and <video> is very flashy. They lived in HTML town, and their parent elements got tired of them trying to one-up each other, so they made them work together and they ended up putting on quite a lovely presentation for everyone. Now they are best friends and do karate in the garage together.
