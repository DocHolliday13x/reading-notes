## Discussion Questions

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? A psychologically safe team provides a sense of confidence that the team will not:

* embarrass a team member
* reject a team member
* punish a team member

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

* During my time with a particular team that made up my small boat crew, of which I was the leader, I realize looking back that we unknowingly kept a psychologically safe setting for one another. Even though I was the technical shot caller, I delegated responsibility to each crew member and respected their input regarding anything in their wheelhouse, and in turn, they respected each decision I would make based on their input. Other than the casual jokes directed at one another, we all held each other in high respect. We implemented all three key factors that contribute to a psychologically safe setting.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

* Higher levels of of performance and lower levels of interpersonal conflict.
