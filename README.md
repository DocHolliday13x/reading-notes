# About Me

My name is Ryan Eastman!

I look forward to my experience with Code Fellows and all my classmates as we progress through the program.


## What is Growth Mindset?

Growth Mindset is the state of thought where you can develop your abilities through hard work and determination.

- Reminder 1: When I find myself struggling with my work, I take a step back and try to gain a different perspective in regards to the topic at hand. 
- Reminder 2: Failure isn't the end! It's simply a learning opportunity.
- Reminder 3: Don't be too proud to ask for help. We can't possibly know everything, but when we ask smart questions, someone else may have the answers you seek.
