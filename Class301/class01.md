1. *What is a “component”?* A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

2. *What are the characteristics of a component?* Characteristics of a component are that it is reusable, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent.

3. *What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?* The advantages of using component-based architecture are that it is easier to develop, easier to maintain, easier to replace, easier to reuse, and easier to test.
