### Reading Statement

Why this topic matters as it relates to the material I am studying: We will be using CRUD API a lot, not only this week, but in our final 301 week as well.

### CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API? The PUT method

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter? PUT and DELETE

### Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API Video

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD? CRUD allows us to manipulate information that describes functions while REST allows us control over data through HTTP commands.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
   * Step 1: create a router.
   * Step 2: Enable all the paths needed in the router.
   * Step 3: Mount the routes so that they can be accessed and set up try/catch on each path created with your routes.
   * Step four, insert the values into the database.
   * Step five, create the front end to allow the interface of the API.

#### Things I Would Like to Know More About

1. Although it was pretty neat watching somone speed run building a CRUD API, it left me feeling confused and wondering if I will reach that level of skill at any point in the near future. Probably not.
