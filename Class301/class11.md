### Reading Statement

Why this topic matters as it relates to the material I am studying:

### nosql vs sql

1. *Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:*
| SQL    | NoSQL |
| -------- | ------- |
| Table based databases |  document based, key-value pairs, graph database or wide-column stores  |
|  Primarily relational databases |  Primarily non-relational or distributed databases  |
|  Vertically scalable, scaled by increasing horsepower of the hardware | Horizontally scalable, scaled by increasing the database servers in the pool of resources to reduce load  |
|  Uses structured query language for defining and manipulating data, very powerful | queries are focused on collection of documents, sometimes called UnQL    |
| Predefined schema  | dynamic schema for unstructured data   |

2. *What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?* SQL databases are good for complex query intensive environments, they are best fit for data that is not heirarchical.

3. *Give a real world example.* SQL databases are good for heavy duty transactional type applications, so something like processing payments through a webpage.

4. *What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?* NoSQL databases are better for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair of storing data similar to a JSON.

5. *Give a real world example.* An itemized set of data that needed to house something that involves key value pairs, like displaying a brand with a specific type of clothing.

6. *Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?* NoSQL

7. *Which type of database is best for scalability?* SQL

### SQL vs NoSQL Videos

1. *What does SQL stand for?* Structured Query Language

2. *What is a relational database?* A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3. *What type of structure does a relational database work with?* A relational database works with tables.

4. *What is a ‘schema’?* A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects.

5. *What is a NoSQL database?* NoSQL databases are non-relational databases.

6. *How does it work?* NoSQL databases store data in a format other than the traditional row-column model.

7. *What is inside of a MongoDB database?* MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents which makes the database very flexible and scalable.

8. *Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.* MongoDB is more flexible because it stores data in JSON-like documents.

9. *What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?* The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that it does not have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
