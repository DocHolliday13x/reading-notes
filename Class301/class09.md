### Reading Statement

Why this topic matters as it relates to the material I am studying:

### Functional Programming Concepts

1. *What is functional programming?* Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. *What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?* A pure function is a function that has no side effects and always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. We can tell if something is a pure function if it returns the same result every time it is called with the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects.

3. *What are the benefits of a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?* The benefits of a pure function are that it is easier to test, easier to debug, and easier to reason about. We can tell if something is a pure function if it returns the same result every time it is called with the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects.

4. *What is immutability?* Immutability is when data is immutable, or unchangeable.

5. *What is a referential transparency?* Referential transparency is when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

### Node JS Tutorial

1. *What is a module?* A module is a file that contains code that can be imported into another file.

2. *What does the word 'require' do?* The word require is used to import a module into another file.

3. *How do we bring in another module into the file that we are working in?* We bring in another module into the file that we are working in by using the require keyword.

4. *What do we have to do to make a module available?* We have to export the module using the module.exports keyword.
