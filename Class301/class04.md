### Reading Statement

Why this topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module?

### React Docs - Forms

1. What is a "controlled component"?


2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?


3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?


### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?


2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
