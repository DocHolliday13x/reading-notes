1. Diversity efforts are most successful when driven by a commitment from company leaders.

2. Because diversity brings forth more creative solutions since people have the ability to view the problems from a completely different perspective.

3. Disabilities or characteristics can be looked over if there isn't a diverse approach to a project.
