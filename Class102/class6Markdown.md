## Notes

* JS is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
* Prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language supporting object-orientated, imperative, and functional programming styles. 
* Well known as the scripting language for Web pages.
* Standards are the ECMAScript Language Specification.
* JavaScript and Java are **_NOT_** the same.
* Any text editor can be used. But we like VScode :)
* Input/Output
  * How we interact with JS in the browse (Prompt/Alert)

* 3 Major Parts Usually Refered to as JavaScript
  * 1. The language itself.
  * 2. The DOM-API - how the language can interact with various parts of a web page.
  * 3. API - (the server API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.
