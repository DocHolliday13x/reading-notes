# What is Growth Mindset?

Growth Mindset is the state of thought where you can develop your abilities through hard work and determination.

- Reminder 1: **When I find myself struggling...**

> I take a step back and try to gain a different perspective in regards to the topic at hand.

- Reminder 2: **Failure _IS NOT_ the end!**

> It's simply a learning opportunity.

- Reminder 3: **Don't be too proud to ask for help!**

> We can't possibly know everything, but when we ask smart questions, someone else may have the answers you seek.
