## AWS S3

1. What is Amazon S3?
    - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

2. Name some use cases for Amazon S3.
    - Backup and restore
    - Disaster recovery
    - Archive data at the lowest cost
    - Data lakes and big data analytics
    - Run cloud-native applications

3. Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.
    - Create buckets
    - Upload objects
    - Download objects
    - Manage access permissions
    - Use Object Lock to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model

## AWS Lambda Basics

1. What is AWS Lambda?
    - AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.

2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.
    - Data processing
    - Real-time file processing
    - Extract, transform, and load (ETL) for data processing
    - Real-time stream processing
    - Backends

3. Describe "serverless" to a non-technical friend.
    - Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.

## CDN

1. What is a CDN?
    - A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?
    - A CDN is a network of servers that delivers webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?
    - Improved website load times
    - Reduced bandwidth costs
    - Increased content availability and redundancy
    - Improved website security
