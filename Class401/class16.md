## AWS EC2

1. What is an EC2 Instance?
    - An EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.
    - Hosting a website.
    - Running a web application server.

3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com:
    - ECS is a service that allows you to run containers on AWS. It is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

## EC2 for Humans

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS console?
    - EC2 can be found under the Compute section of the AWS console.

2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
    - T2 Micro is a low cost, general purpose instance type that provides a small amount of CPU resources. XL is a high performance instance type that provides a large amount of CPU resources.

3. Explain a "compute cycle" to a non-technical friend.
    - A compute cycle is a unit of time that a computer spends processing data. The more compute cycles a computer has, the faster it can process data. A computer with a lot of compute cycles can process data faster than a computer with fewer compute cycles.

## Elastic Beanstalk

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?
    - Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud. It is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows you to deploy applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
    - Elastic Beanstalk and EC2 both allow you to deploy applications in the AWS cloud. Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows you to deploy applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. EC2 is a service that allows you to deploy applications on virtual servers in the AWS cloud. Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 to deploy applications.

3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
    - Elastic Beanstalk is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

    - [ ] Goal 1: Creating an application with Elastic Beanstalk.
    - [ ] Goal 2: Memorize eb commands

#### Things I Want to Know More About

1. The nearly infinite realm of the cloud, and whether or not it's a saviour or our doom.
