### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**
The most important thing to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the time and space complexity of the data structure. The time and space complexity of a data structure will determine how efficient the data structure is and how well it will perform in a given situation.

- **How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**
We can ensure that we avoid an infinite recursive call stack by making sure that we have a base case that will stop the recursion. If we do not have a base case, the recursive function will continue to call itself until the call stack is full and the program will crash.
