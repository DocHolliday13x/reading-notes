# Class 41 Reading: Gatsby, Next.js, and other JS Frameworks

## Resources

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
- [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/)
- [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Gatsby.js Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/)

## Next.js

1. What is `Next.js`?

    - `Next.js` is a React framework for production. It makes it easy to create `React` apps that run on the server.

2. What does `Next.js` do differently than `React`?

    - `Next.js` is a framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It provides a solution to the problem of client-side rendering (CSR) vs server-side rendering (SSR) by providing a middle ground between the two.

## Gatsby.js

1. What is `Gatsby.js`?

    - `Gatsby.js` is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It uses powerful preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, smart image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching.

2. What does `Gatsby.js` do differently than `React`?

    - `Gatsby.js` is a static site generator for React. It uses GraphQL to pull data from a variety of sources and then generates static pages using React. It's a great way to build a website that is fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

### Reflection

- [Class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-43/)

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

    - [ ] Goal 1: I want to know what's different about these two frameworks that solves the Search Enginge Optimization (SEO) problem that React has.
    - [ ] Goal 2: I want to know what the difference is between a static site generator and a server-side rendered site.
    - [ ] Goal 3: I want to build a web application using Next.js because it sounds like it's easier to use than Vue has been in my experience.

#### Things I Want to Know More About

1. I want to know why the class reading says we will be able to use other frameworks after barely walking us through Gatsby and Next. I feel like I'm going to need a lot more practice with all of these frameworks before I can use them effectively.
