### Additional Questions

1. Note the naming conventions in the [AirBnB React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/#naming). What patterns do you see?

    - I can see that the naming conventions are camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components, and UPPER_CASE for constants.

2. Looking ahead at this module's [Course Schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-6), what do you look forward to learning?

    - I look forward to learning more about React and how to use it to build a full-stack application. I also look forward to learning more about the different types of components and how to use them. I would like to implement more advanced components than I have in past projects.

3. What are your learning goals after reading the the [Class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-26/)?

    - [ ] Goal 1: I want to read up on Angular and Vue to see how they compare to React.
    - [ ] Goal 2: I want to get to lawyer level when debating Libraries vs. Frameworks.
