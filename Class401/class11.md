## Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
    - The `events` module.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
    - The value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming is that it allows us to create objects that can emit events and listen for them.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
    - Event Driven Programming is useful on the backend using Node.js because it allows us to create objects that can emit events and listen for them. This allows us to create a server that can listen for events and respond to them.
