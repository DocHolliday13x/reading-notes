### Engineering

- **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**
My experience as a leader in the United States Navy has taught me how to work with a team to accomplish a goal. The military also provided me with an environment where I was able to learn how to work with people from all walks of life and how to adapt to different situations. Having gone through two deployments, I learned how to work under pressure and how to prioritize tasks in a manner that exercises discipline to achieve the desired outcome. Over the years, I learned how to work with people from different cultures and how to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds. I believe that these skills will be very beneficial to me as I begin my career as a software developer.

- **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**
Similar to being stuck on a problem in the military, my best bet is to take a step back to try to gain a new perspective on the situation. I will try to break down the problem into smaller pieces and try to tackle each piece individually. I can consult with my peers to see if they have any ideas on how to solve the problem. I will also try to look at the problem from a different angle and try to see if I can find a solution that way. Should all of the above fail, I can reach out to a superior for guidance and ask smart questions so that they can tell I have exhausted all of my previous options without me directly having to say so.
