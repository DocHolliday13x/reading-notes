**Summary: Microsoft and the D.O.D.**

A group of Microsoft employees has written an open letter demanding that the company terminate a contract with the US Army related to the development of augmented reality technology. The contract, worth $749 million, aims to create a platform called Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) to enhance the combat capabilities of soldiers. The employees express their refusal to contribute to warfare and oppression, asserting that they did not join Microsoft to develop weapons. They argue that the use of Microsoft's HoloLens technology in the military context turns war into a simulated video game, dehumanizing the reality of violence. The employees call for the cancellation of the IVAS contract, an end to weapons development, and the establishment of an independent ethics review board to enforce an acceptable use policy. They emphasize the need for transparency and accountability, asserting that Microsoft should inform its engineers about the intended purpose of their work and uphold ethical standards. The letter highlights the employees' concern about being implicated as war profiteers and urges Microsoft to align its mission of empowerment with promoting good and preventing harm.

**Summary: Self-Driving Car Ethics.**

The article discusses the ethical dilemmas faced by self-driving cars when confronted with no-win situations. It presents a hypothetical scenario where a self-driving car must make a split-second decision when a school bus veers toward it on a two-lane road. The article explores the question of what decision the car should make, highlighting the complexities involved in programming such vehicles. It emphasizes that while self-driving cars have the potential to greatly reduce accidents and save lives, they cannot completely eliminate them. The article touches on the trolley problem, where a car must choose between two undesirable outcomes, and the challenges of programming cars to react to various scenarios. It also considers the role of legislation and regulations in determining how self-driving cars should behave in these situations. The article concludes by raising additional ethical considerations, such as how self-driving cars should handle interactions with pedestrians and animals, and the potential impact of their widespread use on neighborhoods and traffic patterns.
