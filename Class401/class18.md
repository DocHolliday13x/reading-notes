## AWS API Gateway Overview

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?
    - Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.

2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless Ecosystem?
    - Amazon API Gateway is an important part of the Serverless Ecosystem because it allows you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.

3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?
    - API Gateway integrates with other AWS services by allowing you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.

## ASW API Gateway

1. What are some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?
    - Some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway are:
        - Efficiently connect to a wide variety of backend systems, including HTTP-based RESTful APIs and non-HTTP based AWS and third-party APIs, to develop a unified REST API.
        - Create RESTful APIs that enable

2. What are two API types that you might choose from?
    - Two API types that you might choose from are:
        - REST APIs
        - WebSocket APIs

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

1. What is DynamoDB?
    - DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

2. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?
    - I would recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB when you need a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

## AWS DynamoDB

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.
    - DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

## Dynamoose

1. What is Dynamoose?
    - Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB (inspired by Mongoose)

2. What are some key features of Dynamoose?
   - It is built on top of the AWS SDK for Node.js
   - It is designed with TypeScript
   - it is promise based
   - it has built in support for: DynamoDB Transactions, Global Secondary Indexes, Versioning, Time To Live (TTL), DynamoDB Streams, DynamoDB On-Demand, DynamoDB Local, DocumentClient
   - It has built in support for DynamoDB DocumentClient: BatchGet, BatchWrite, Query, Scan, Get, Put, Update, Delete, TransactGet, TransactWrite

### Reflection

- [Class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-18/)

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

    - [ ] Goal 1: I feel like there is so much to learn about AWS, and that there are so many feautres to Dynamoose alone that I need to spend some time reviewing.
