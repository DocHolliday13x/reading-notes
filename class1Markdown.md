## Some Notes!

I have almost NO prior experience using GitHub. Yet, Markdown is a tool that I feel I am quickly grasping the basic concepts of. It was intimidating at first sight, but the more I find myself utilizing it, the more I can identify how wonderful of a notetaking tool this can be. I can format my notes precisely how I want to, and there are resources (linked above) to help identify specific syntax and how to utilize them. GitHub itself is fantastic for storing my notes, and with proper structure -- such as embedding links to specific notes within some sort of table of contents -- I can easily locate and review/revise my notes. This is a fantastic tool and I look forward to better understanding how best to utilize it. 

### Things I Would Like to Know More About

I need to practice implementing the tools available. I would like to get to a point where I can effectively alter the appearance of my webpage, such as implement a theme, add images, and simply make my notes more appealing to the eye.
